# 🎄 Advent of Code

Welcome!  
This repository contains my solutions to **Advent of Code**, organized by **year** and **day**.

Each puzzle is solved in Python and kept as clean and readable as possible. I also add short explanations so future-me (and others!) can understand the approach again later.

## 📁 Structure
- One folder per year (`2025/`, `2026/`, …)
- Inside each year, one folder per day:
  - `day-X-part-1.py`
  - `day-X-part-2.py`
  - `input.txt`
  - `README.md` (problem summary, approach, complexity)

## 🎯 Why this repo exists
- To practice problem-solving and algorithms
- To keep a tidy archive of solutions
- To have fun solving Christmas puzzles 🎄✨

More years and puzzles will be added over time!
